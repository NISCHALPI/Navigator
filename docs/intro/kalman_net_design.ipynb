The dynamics, for example, the position of the moving object, is also generally non-linear. Hence, the traditional KF is not applicable. The EKF and UKF are applicable, but they require the knowledge of the noise characteristics of the system. This is not always available or easy to obtain. However, the RNN can learn the noise characteristics of the given system using the labeled data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. How does the training data look like?  \n",
    "    Just like any neural network, training data will contaion an input X and a labelled output Y. Since the base architecture of the Kalman Net is RNN, the input will be time series of the observables,\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What about the reciever clock bias and drift?  \n",
    "    The reciever clock bias and drift are not observables since they are very hard to measure with high accuracy and are generally noisy. So, they are not included in the training data. So, we will have to simultaneously eliminate them and gain some advantage doing that. This is done by using the single differenced measurement model. The single differenced measurement mode. Hence out state space model becomes:\n",
